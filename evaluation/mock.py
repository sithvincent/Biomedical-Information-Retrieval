The secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of FIs on outcomes. Four hundred and ten patients undergoing LT from January 2015 until January 2023 in a tertiary university hospital were included in the present retrospective cohort study to investigate the risk factors of FIs and to assess the impacts of FIs on the prognosis of LT recipients using logistic regression. The incidence of FIs was 12.4% (51/410), and median time from LT to the onset of FIs was 3\xa0days. By univariate analysis, advanced recipient age, prolonged hospital stay prior to LT, high Model for End Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, use of broad-spectrum antibiotics, and elevated white blood cell (WBC) count, increased operating time, massive blood loss and red blood cell transfusion, elevated alanine aminotransferase on day 1 and creatinine on day 3 after LT, prolonged duration of urethral catheter, prophylactic antifungal therapy, the need for mechanical ventilation and renal replacement therapy were identified as factors of increased post-LT FIs risk.

We included adults enrolled in the Functional Assessment in Liver Transplantation study. We completed latent class trajectory analyses to define MAP trajectories. We completed time-dependent Cox-regression analyses to test the association between outpatient MAP and 3 cirrhosis-related outcomes: (1) stage 2 acute kidney injury (AKI), defined as a ≥200% increase in serum creatinine from baseline; (2) a 5-point increase in the MELD-Na score, defined as the incidence of increase from initial MELD-Na; (3) waitlist mortality, defined as death on the waitlist. For each outcome, we defined MAP cut points by determining the maximally selected Log-rank statistic after univariable Cox-regression analyses. Among the 1786 patients included in this analysis, our latent class trajectory analyses identified 3 specific outpatient MAP trajectories: "stable-low," "stable-high," and "increasing-to-decreasing." However, >80% of patients were in a "stable-low" trajectory. We found in adjusted analyses that outpatient MAP was associated with each of our outcomes: Stage 2 AKI (adjusted hazard ratio 0.88 per 10\xa0mm\xa0Hg increase in MAP [95% CI: 0.79-0.99]); 5-point increase in MELD-Na (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.91 [95% CI: 0.86-0.96]; waitlist mortality (adjusted hazard ratio: 0.89 [95% CI: 0.81-0.96]). For each outcome, we found that an outpatient MAP of 82\xa0mm\xa0Hg was most associated with outcomes ( p <0.05 for all). Our study informs the association between outpatient MAP and cirrhosis-related outcomes. These findings, coupled with the identification of specific thresholds, lay the foundation for the trial of targeted outpatient MAP modulation in patients with cirrhosis.',

  'content': "Acute-on-Chronic Liver Failure: Causes, Clinical Parameters, and Predictors of Mortality.Objectives This study aimed to identify the causes, clinical characteristics, and 28-day in-hospital mortality predictors in patients with acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Methods A cross-sectional study enrolled sixty-four patients aged 18-70 years with acute-on-chronic liver failure. The study was conducted at the Gastroenterology Department, Lahore General Hospital. The study classified ACLF according to the criteria of the European Association for the Study of the Liver - Chronic Liver Failure (EASL-CLIF). Patients were followed for 28 days for mortality outcomes. The outcomes between Survivor and Non-survivor groups were compared using the Chi-Square/Fisher's Exact Test for categorical variables and the Mann-Whitney U test for continuous variables. Results In this study, age and duration of chronic liver disease were not significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. The etiology of liver disease and ACLF\xa0causes had no impact on 28-day mortality. Non-survivors had lower mean arterial pressure, and higher mortality was linked with lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, and Grade IV hepatic encephalopathy. Significant differences in bilirubin, serum creatinine, urea, and C-reactive protein levels were observed at 28 days. Survival rates were highest with single organ failure (35.94%) and decreased with multiple organ failures. The overall survival rate was 51.56%. Predictive validity for mortality was assessed using the Area Under the Curve (AUC), with\xa0Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) at 0.679, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) at 0.819, and Chronic Liver Failure-Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (CLIF-SOFA) at 0.771. Conclusion This study concludes that in acute-on-chronic liver failure, factors like age, gender, and disease etiology do not significantly predict 28-day mortality. Key mortality indicators include clinical parameters such as lower Glasgow Coma Scale scores, hepatic encephalopathy Grade IV, and laboratory findings like elevated bilirubin and serum creatinine. The MELD score is the most compelling prognostic tool.",

  'content': 'Predictors of Acute Kidney Injury in Patients Hospitalized With Liver Cirrhosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.Acute kidney injury (AKI) frequently occurs in hospitalized individuals with liver cirrhosis and represents a significant risk factor for early in-hospital mortality, holding crucial clinical and prognostic importance. The objective of this meta-analysis was to assess the risk factors associated with AKI in hospitalized individuals with cirrhosis. This systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted in concordance with guidelines provided by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement. Two independent researchers systematically searched major databases, including MEDLINE/PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE, from January 2015 until December 2023. A total of 14 studies were included in this meta-analysis, of which six were prospective, and the remaining were retrospective. Of the 9,659 cirrhosis patients in the 14 included studies, 3,968 had developed AKI with a pooled incidence of 41% (95% confidence interval = 34-47%). Our findings showed that a high Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, infection, high Child-Pugh-Turcotte stage score, high serum creatinine, high serum bilirubin, and low serum albumin were significantly associated with high incidence of AKI in liver cirrhosis patients. The results emphasize the importance of vigilant monitoring in cirrhosis patients to detect any indications of AKI, followed by meticulous and attentive management.',
